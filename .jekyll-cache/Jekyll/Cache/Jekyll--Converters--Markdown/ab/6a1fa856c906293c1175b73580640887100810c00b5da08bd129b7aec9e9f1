I"T<p>This project was mainly a means of learning Unreal Engine 4 (UE4).
As working with N’th dimensional arrays can become computationally
expensive, I would probably try to use something lower level like OpenGL.
In any case, cellular automata are relatively easy to implement in
any language, and so should provide a good opportunity to learn UE4.</p>

<p>To start with, an introduction to
<a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Cellular_automaton">Cellular Automata</a>.
They are also called “0 player games,” because you can imagine them
as game boards that develop their states with 0 input.  They do this
through adjacency conditions.  For example, the most famous cellular automata
is <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Conway’s Game of Life</a>,
which has the conditions B3/S23.  A cell is “born” if it has 3 adjacencies.
(where being born means the cell becomes active/alive), “survives” if it has
2 or 3 adjacencies (there is no change in state), and “dies” otherwise
(the cell becomes inactive/dead).</p>

<p>There are an extreme number of rules, specifically…</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;span&gt;&amp;Sigma;&lt;/span&gt;
    k ( N - k + 1 )
&lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Beginning the project, I used the default “First Person Shooter” template.
I picked this template because I thought that being able to walk 
around a 3D automaton as it develops would be interesting.</p>
