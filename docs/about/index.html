            <p>Welcome to my website! I am a passionate and dedicated individual with a strong background in Computer Science. I hold a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, which I completed at UTD in May 2020. During my time there, I pursued a 3 Year Degree and also had the opportunity to work as a CS tutor, sharing my knowledge and helping fellow students excel in their studies.</p>
<p>Continuing my academic journey, I pursued a Master of Science in Computer Science and Interactive Computing, which I completed in just one year, graduating in May 2021. This fast-track degree provided me with an in-depth understanding of cutting-edge technologies and their applications in interactive computing.</p>

From developing web applications using C#, Vue, and SQLServer to working with Python and AWS Image Rekognition, I have embraced diverse technologies to deliver innovative solutions. Additionally, I contributed to projects in the fields of PHP, MySQL, Unity Game Engine, and Android Studio, showcasing my versatility and adaptability.</p>
<p>With a focus on continuous learning and staying updated with the latest advancements, I am always eager to take on new challenges and contribute to meaningful projects. I am excited to share my experiences and expertise with you on this platform. Feel free to explore my projects and learn more about my journey in the world of Computer Science.
