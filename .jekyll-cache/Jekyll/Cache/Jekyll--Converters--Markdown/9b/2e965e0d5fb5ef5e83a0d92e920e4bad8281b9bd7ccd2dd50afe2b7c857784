I"ê<p>This website was made primarily as a resume material, secondarily
to learn HTML/CSS.</p>

<p><a href="http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/">http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/</a>
helped with setting up Github Pages and initial Jekyll organization.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/01-setup/">Jekyll Step by Step Tutorial</a>
was great for finishing up my Jekyll setup (Obviously).  Jekyll as a whole
is also super helpful for keeping my workspace organized (Mostly).</p>

<p>I used <a href="https://www.google.com/">this invaluable site</a> for any general troubleshooting
I had.  Would definitely recommend it.</p>
