I"û<p>This project was mainly a means of learning Unreal Engine 4 (UE4).
As working with N‚Äôth dimensional arrays can become computationally
expensive, I would probably try to use something lower level like OpenGL.
In any case, cellular automata are relatively easy to implement in
any language, and so should provide a good opportunity to learn UE4.</p>

<p>To start with, an introduction to
<a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Cellular_automaton">Cellular Automata</a>.
They are also called ‚Äú0 player games,‚Äù because you can imagine them
as game boards that develop their states with 0 input.  They do this
through adjacency conditions.  For example, the most famous cellular automata
is <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Conway‚Äôs Game of Life</a>,
which has the conditions B3/S23.  A cell is ‚Äúborn‚Äù if it has 3 adjacencies.
(where being born means the cell becomes active/alive), ‚Äúsurvives‚Äù if it has
2 or 3 adjacencies (there is no change in state), and ‚Äúdies‚Äù otherwise
(the cell becomes inactive/dead).</p>

<p>There are an extreme number of rules, specifically‚Ä¶</p>

<p><code>&Theta;</code></p>

<p>Beginning the project, I used the default ‚ÄúFirst Person Shooter‚Äù template.
I picked this template because I thought that being able to walk 
around a 3D automaton as it develops would be interesting.</p>
